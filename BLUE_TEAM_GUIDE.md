## 🔍 Threat Hunting

### What is Threat Hunting?

Proactive search for threats that evaded automated defenses:
- **IOC Detection** - Find malware, C2 beacons, lateral movement
- **Behavioral Analysis** - Detect anomalous patterns
- **Attack Chain Correlation** - Connect the dots across events
- **MITRE Mapping** - Identify attacker TTPs

### Basic Threat Hunt (2-5 Minutes)

```bash
# Hunt threats in system logs (fastest!)
scorpion threat-hunt --logs /var/log/auth.log --time-limit 3

# Hunt across multiple log files
scorpion threat-hunt --logs /var/log/ --time-limit 5

# Filter by severity
scorpion threat-hunt --logs access.log --severity critical

# Generate JSON report
scorpion threat-hunt --logs /var/log/ --output threats.json
```

### What Scorpion Detects

**🚨 CRITICAL Threats:**
- Reverse shells & C2 beacons
- Credential dumping (mimikatz, hashdump)
- Privilege escalation attempts
- Ransomware indicators
- Data exfiltration (large transfers)

**⚠️  HIGH Threats:**
- Brute force attacks (SSH, RDP, FTP)
- Lateral movement (PsExec, WinRM)
- Suspicious PowerShell/CMD execution
- Port scanning from internal hosts
- Living-off-the-Land binary abuse

**📊 MEDIUM Threats:**
- Registry persistence mechanisms
- Scheduled task creation
- Suspicious DNS queries (tunneling)
- Unusual process parent-child relationships
- Failed authentication patterns

### Real-World Examples

#### Example 1: Detect Compromised Account
```bash

#   • High-entropy subdomains: aGVsbG8gd29ybGQ.evil-c2.tk
#   • 120 DNS queries in 5 minutes (20x baseline)
#   • MITRE: T1071.004 (Application Layer Protocol: DNS)
#   • Action: Block evil-c2.tk, isolate infected host!
```

#### Example 3: Detect Ransomware
```bash
# Hunt for ransomware indicators
scorpion threat-hunt --logs file_activity.log --severity critical

# Output (in 3 minutes):
# 🚨 CRITICAL: Potential Ransomware Activity

#   • File extensions changed: .docx → .encrypted
#   • Shadow copies deleted (vssadmin)
#   • MITRE: T1486 (Data Encrypted for Impact)
#   • Action: Isolate system IMMEDIATELY, restore from backup!
```

### Advanced Threat Hunting

#### Hunt Across Entire Network
```bash
# Collect logs from all servers first
scp server1:/var/log/auth.log logs/server1_auth.log
scp server2:/var/log/auth.log logs/server2_auth.log

# Hunt across all logs
scorpion threat-hunt --logs logs/ --time-limit 10 --output network_threats.json

# AI correlates events across all systems!
```
