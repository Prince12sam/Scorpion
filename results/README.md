# Results Directory

This directory stores scan results and output files generated by Scorpion CLI.

## ⚠️ Important Security Notice

**DO NOT commit scan results to version control!**

Scan results may contain:
- Sensitive information about target systems
- Discovered vulnerabilities
- Network topology information
- Service version details
- Potential security weaknesses

## File Types

This directory may contain:
- `scan_*.json` - Port scan results
- `tech_*.json` - Technology detection results
- `web_*.json` - Web vulnerability scan results
- `suite_*.json` - Test suite results
- `api_*.json` - API security test results
- `ssl_*.json` - SSL/TLS analysis results
- `recon_*.json` - Reconnaissance results
- `ai_pentest_*.json` - AI penetration test results
- And other scan output formats

## Best Practices

1. **Keep results local**: Never commit to git
2. **Secure storage**: Store results in encrypted locations
3. **Regular cleanup**: Delete old results you no longer need
4. **Access control**: Restrict access to authorized personnel only
5. **Retention policy**: Follow your organization's data retention requirements

## Git Protection

The `.gitignore` file is configured to exclude all result files.
Only the `.gitkeep` file is tracked to maintain the directory structure.

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Save scan results
scorpion scan -t target.com --web --output results/scan_target.json

# Save multiple scan types
scorpion suite -t target.com --profile web --output-dir results

# View results
cat results/scan_target.json | jq .

# Generate HTML report from results
scorpion report --suite results/suite_*.json --output report.html
```

## Cleanup

To remove old results:

```bash
# Remove all JSON results
rm results/*.json

# Remove results older than 30 days (Linux/macOS)
find results/ -name "*.json" -mtime +30 -delete

# Remove results older than 30 days (Windows PowerShell)
Get-ChildItem results/*.json | Where-Object {$_.LastWriteTime -lt (Get-Date).AddDays(-30)} | Remove-Item
```

**Remember: Treat scan results as confidential security data!**
